Hello Friends!

I have been writing instructions for computers since the early 1980s. Sometimes I do it professionally, and sometimes I do it for fun, or to have more control over the world we live in.

Currently (2020 as of this writing) I've been mostly doing Arduino things, some Jekyll stuff, and always dabble in shell scripts, Perl, a bit of Python, Processing, and the like. (More and more of my projects and work can be found in the [Brown Dog Gadgets](https://github.com/BrownDogGadgets) repositories.)

There's a good chance nothing I publish will be groundbreaking or amazing, but if I can share what I know and help one person, that's enough. I've learned so much from others willing to share, that if I can give back, I will.

Oh, if you want to check out my other publishing endeavors, see [RasterWeb!](http://rasterweb.net/raster/) which has been going strong(?) since 1997.
